The HR Portal Front-End project is a simple, modern web application designed to simulate common HR workflows in a clean and user-friendly way. The system allows two types of users—employees and HR personnel—to complete their respective tasks through a responsive React interface. Employees can update their personal profile information and submit leave requests, while HR staff can add new employees, edit existing employee data, delete employees, and review or approve leave submissions. The goal is not to build a backend or a full HR system, but rather to demonstrate the student’s ability to design and implement core front-end functionality using React.

The application uses React Router for page navigation, Bootstrap for layout and styling, and local component state to manage and update information. A simple role-selection system at login simulates authentication by storing the user’s chosen role in localStorage, which enables basic role-based access control. For example, HR-only pages and actions cannot be accessed when logged in as an employee. All major interactions—such as clicking buttons, submitting forms, or opening modals—also generate console logs to clearly show what the system is doing at each step.

To support styling and customization, the project includes a lightweight theme system with color, spacing, and layout overrides. The codebase is organized into reusable components, making it easy to maintain, extend, or adapt the project for future use. Finally, the project is fully deployable and includes configuration templates for multiple hosting providers. Overall, this HR Portal demonstrates the core skills required for the Capstone: component-based design, routing, state management, responsive UI, role simulation, and workflow handling using React.

It was built as a front end only, application relying on the local storage and json files, but was written with a Phase 2 in mind. It is ready to turn into a fullstack application taking advantage of real time database through firebase.
