Important NOTE:
Modern React + Vite Conventions (2025 Update)

(Annotation – Do Not Remove)

This project follows **current industry-standard React + Vite practices (React 19, Vite 7)

1. **No manual `index.html` editing** — Vite manages the entry HTML internally.
2. **`App.jsx` is the functional “index page”** — it serves as the main layout and router host.
3. **`main.jsx` bootstraps React** — it mounts the app using `ReactDOM.createRoot()`; no HTML edits required.
4. **File structure** follows:

   ```
   src/
   ├── App.jsx          ← root-level layout and routes
   ├── main.jsx         ← entry point (imports App)
   ├── pages/           ← routed pages (Login, HRDashboard, EmployeeDashboard)
   ├── components/      ← reusable UI elements (Navbar, Footer, etc.)
   ├── routes/          ← router configuration (router.jsx)
   ├── firebase.js      ← database config and export
   └── assets/          ← static assets
   ```
5. **Firebase Realtime Database** is used only as a live JSON endpoint; no custom backend logic.
6. **Bootstrap 5** handles layout and responsiveness (Tailwind optional).
7. **Exports always appear at the bottom of files.**

This annotation supersedes all legacy patterns (manual `index.html`, direct DOM rendering, etc.). Future updates or threads must follow this structure.

**🚀 Project Kickoff – HR Portal Front-End (Capstone Project)**

This post begins our discussion on the Phase-End Project. To start, here’s the **Project Charter**, which defines the purpose, scope, and structure of our work. A **project charter** is a short document that authorizes the project and gives a clear picture of its goals, scope, key roles, and success criteria—it serves as the foundation for all planning and execution steps that follow.

### **Project Charter – HR Portal Front-End (Capstone Project)**

**Purpose / Objective:**
Develop a responsive, user-friendly HR portal that enables employees to register, update profiles, and submit leave requests while allowing HR staff to manage employee data efficiently.

**Scope:**

* Built with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vite, Bootstrap, and Firebase Realtime Database**.
* Design based on **CRAP principles** (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).
* Role-based access for Employee and HR users.
* Includes login/signup, profile management, and leave request modules.
* Integrates Firebase for storage, authentication, and dynamic updates.
* Maintains full Git version history with clear commits.

**Deliverables:**

1. Intro / Landing Page (Project Charter + “Enter Portal” link)
2. Login / Signup Page (Firebase authentication)
3. Employee Dashboard (profile + leave request)
4. HR Dashboard (employee data + leave approval)
5. Firebase Realtime Database integration
6. Bootstrap UI using CRAP design principles
7. React Router navigation and role-based access
8. GitHub repository with version control
9. Inline documentation and setup notes
10. Working demo via Vite dev server

Convention NOTE: Every file will follow this same pattern:

Imports

Declarations (functions, hooks, constants)

export statements at the end

That way, if you add more components or utility functions to the same file later, all your exports stay grouped and predictable.


Here’s the **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** formatted in standard numbered outline form — concise, hierarchical, and aligned with your **Capstone FSD Front-End with React** deliverables and scope.  Keep track of what we have completed and what step we are on at all times.

---

# **HR Portal Front-End (Capstone Project) – Work Breakdown Structure**

## **1.0 Project Initialization**

1.1 Create project folder and initialize React + Vite environment
1.2 Install dependencies (React Router, Bootstrap, Firebase)
1.3 Configure Firebase project and `.env` environment variables
1.4 Verify Realtime Database connection (read test from `/users`)
1.5 Initialize Git repository and make initial commit

---

## **2.0 Base Structure and Routing**

2.1 Create directory structure: `/src/pages`, `/src/components`, `/src/routes`
2.2 Build initial pages:
 2.2.1 `App.jsx` (Landing / Project Charter page)
 2.2.2 `Login.jsx` (Simulated login)
 2.2.3 `EmployeeDashboard.jsx`
 2.2.4 `HRDashboard.jsx`
2.3 Configure routing in `router.jsx` (paths: `/`, `/login`, `/employee`, `/hr`)
2.4 Test route navigation and component rendering

---

## **3.0 Firebase Integration**

3.1 Connect `firebase.js` to Realtime Database using `getDatabase(app)`
3.2 Implement read functions for `/users`
3.3 Implement write functions for `/leaveRequests`
3.4 Implement update and delete for HR approval workflow
3.5 Validate CRUD operations and confirm data synchronization

---

## **4.0 UI Design and Layout**

4.1 Apply Bootstrap grid and responsive layout system
4.2 Implement CRAP design principles:
 4.2.1 Contrast – readable color palette
 4.2.2 Repetition – consistent buttons, headers
 4.2.3 Alignment – uniform margins and grids
 4.2.4 Proximity – logical grouping of related elements
4.3 Build reusable UI components:
 4.3.1 Navigation bar
 4.3.2 Footer
 4.3.3 Cards and forms
4.4 Verify responsive behavior across devices

---

## **5.0 Role Logic and Data Binding**

5.1 Build login logic (match email from `/users` to determine role)
5.2 Redirect users to correct dashboard based on role (HR / Employee)
5.3 Bind Firebase data to dashboard components dynamically
5.4 Implement form validation and submission feedback

---

## **6.0 Documentation and Version Control**

6.1 Write inline code documentation (purpose and rationale)
6.2 Draft project README (installation, setup, usage)
6.3 Maintain clean commit history with descriptive messages
6.4 Push final version to GitHub repository

---

## **7.0 Testing and Presentation**

7.1 Conduct functional testing (navigation, CRUD, role routing)
7.2 Conduct UI/UX testing (responsiveness, accessibility)
7.3 Prepare screen recording or demo walkthrough for submission
7.4 Finalize project evaluation checklist and archive deliverables
